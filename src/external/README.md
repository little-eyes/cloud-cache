## Data Generator
The `data generator` is used to create the 3-sat input data. Use the following command to build the generator:
> $ g++ 3-sat-data.cc -o 3-sat-data

Then you will see the executable file `3-sat-data`, run it with the following style:
> $ ./3-sat-data -n [number of cases]

After you execute this, you will be able to get a file `3-sat.in` which contains the input data to the solver.
