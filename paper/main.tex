\begin{abstract}
In this document, an alternative approach is proposed to solve some very hard problems (e.g. 3-SAT and other NP-Complete problems) by using the power of cloud. The fundamental idea behinds this alternative approach is \emph{caching}. Since those NP-Complete problems have very large solution space, the cache requires a very large amount of storage where the cloud computing provides such a convenience to support the necessity. In this document, we design and implement a framework which abstract the problem and solution as a \emph{key-value} object pair, such that its subproblems can also form some key-value object pairs. We store the key-value object pairs inside the CloudCache, and two simple cache APIs \emph{query()} and \emph{push()} are provided to support the caching operations. Besides, we simplify the problem solving framework as a \emph{kernel-solver} where people can define how they are going to solve a hard problem (like 3-SAT or Traveling Salesman Problem) using CloudCache framework very easily. To evaluate the performance of the framework, we deploy the framework to $6$ Amazon EC2 micro instances and try to solve $1,000,000$ 3-SAT problem instances using the framework. The solution results are optimistic regarding whether this caching approach could be an alternative way to solve hard problems.
